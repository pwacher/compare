# compare
Just playing around with planning a js program

Goal:
Compare two arrays of numbers and print out numbers which are the same.

Steps:
- Get length of the array using .length method
- Loop/step through the first array using a for loop
- Compare it to each of the numbers in the second array by using a nested for loop and if statement
- If a match is found, document.write it to the page.
